# FlyingTasters

FlyingTasters is a solution that provides formation flight capabilities to a set of CrazyFlie drones [link]. It started as a colaboration between PDEng trainees from TU-Eindhoven and ESA developers. The goal of such collaboration was to use the TASTE toolchain [link] during the process and result in a demo [link] presented to the public at the ESA open days.

In this repository you will find detailed description of:

* The rationale and design decisions used,
* the process to build your own FlyingTasters,
* the steps required in order to make changes and extend the FlyingTasters system.
